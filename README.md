# Favorite Games Website

This project was developed as part of a course at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) in 2023. 

## Description

The website allows users to manage their favorite games by adding images of their games, viewing them in a gallery, and removing the last added image. 

Key features include:
- **Add Images**: Users can upload images of their favorite games directly from their device.
- **View Gallery**: The uploaded images are displayed in a gallery format.
- **Remove Last Image**: Users have the option to delete the most recently added image.

All images are stored locally in the user's browser using local storage, ensuring a seamless and lightweight experience.
